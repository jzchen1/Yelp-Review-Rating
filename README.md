# Yelp-Review-Rating

This is a game which allows the User to guess the rating that 10 different Yelp Reviews recieved
and to compare his or her accuracy score to an AI trained with a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier.

The User will be asked to input a number from the choices of 1, 2, 4, or 5 stars 10 times.
**Note** There are no 3 star reviews in this game.

The review.csv file is required to run this game.
The file can be acquired from the following link, because it is too large to be uploaded onto github.
